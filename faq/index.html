      <h2>Are you licensed and insured?</h2>
      <p>Yes! we are both licensed and insured.</p>

      <h2>Are estimates provided for free? Can you give estimates over the phone?</h2>
      <p>Yes, estimates are free! We will take your information and have our
         estimator set up a time with you to come and take a look at your
         project. Over the phone we can provide ballparks for smaller jobs
         but it's hard to tell without seeing it, and bigger jobs will typically
         require an estimator visiting. Click here to contact us and get started!
