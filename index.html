        <h2>We Strive to Stand Out</h2>
        <p>We are a residential and commercial electrical company that specializes 
            in residential and service work. we conduct our work in a clean, 
            efficient, quality, workman-like manner. We are known around Northern
            Virginia as the guys who get it done right and make our customers smile.
            We offer a level of service that is to be expected but not always found

            every single day!
