             Hello valued customers!
                I am Joseph Huntington and I bring you the first blog post on our new and improved website!
                We hope to keep you updated and provide you with the tool that is our website. Contact us easily,
                see what services we provide, see some of our work, and read updates from me! If this is your
                first time visiting our site, or hearing about us, allow me to explain what it is that we do.
                We are Huntington Electric. Electricians who service the Northern Virginia area and have been
                doing so proudly for over 25 years. We also proudly support first responders and local communities
                around Loudoun and Fairfax County. We specialize in service and residential work, but also do
                commercial. Fans, lights, troubleshooting, remodeling, new construction, you name it, we do it
                all. At Huntington Electric, there is no job too small.<br>
