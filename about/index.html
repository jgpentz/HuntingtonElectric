        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>We go above and beyond every day to make sure that every name in our
            system is that of a happy and satisfied customer. A customer that feels
            comfortable and safe after our work is done. We are fueled by our loyal
            customers and the new ones we make everyday. We see how other companies
            operate and always strive to do better. It's more than just a smiling face,
            It's also quality work that we provide that keeps your house running safely
            and consistently.
        </p>

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>In 1993 our President and Founder, Blair Huntington, saw how other
            companies operated and worked through many of them, seeing an opportunity
            to provide a higher quality of service that would make customers happier
            than they have ever been with an electrician. We didn't want to be another
            service guy to walk through your doors, we are different, Northern
            Virginia is our family.
