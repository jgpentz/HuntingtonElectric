    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <p>We go above and beyond every day to make sure that every name in our
        system is that of a happy and satisfied customer. A customer that feels
        comfortable and safe after our work is done. We are fueled by our loyal
        customers and the new ones we make everyday. We see how other companies
        operate and always strive to do better. It's more than just a smiling face,
        It's also quality work that we provide that keeps your house running safely
        and consistently.
    </p>

    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>In 1993 our President and Founder, Blair Huntington, saw how other
        companies operated and worked through many of them, seeing an opportunity
        to provide a higher quality of service that would make customers happier
        than they have ever been with an electrician. We didn't want to be another
        service guy to walk through your doors, we are different, Northern
        Virginia is our family.
